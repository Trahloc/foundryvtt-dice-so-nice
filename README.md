# Configuration
There's two type of settings:
- The GM settings can only be modified by a GM user and will affect everyone in this FVTT world.
- The Player's dice settings are linked to a player in a single world and can be modified by himself. These settings won't affect other players settings.
## Appearance
![Preview](./settings-appearance.jpg?raw=true)
- **Enable 3D dices**: Enable the 3D dice display in this browser session.
- **Enable Extra Dice Customization**: Let you customize the appearance of special dice, like d7 or d30.
- **Dice Presets (Faces)**: Allows to select the dices faces. Default is "Standard" where every face is a text label. Some game systems can force this value for all players to display their own dices.
- **Theme**: Allows to select a color theme for your dices. Themes changes every color settings and can pack multiple colors that will be selected at random each time you roll. A theme can also include a default texture that will be displayed if you selected "None / Auto (Theme)" in the "Texture" dropdown.
- **Texture**: Allows to select a texture for the dice. Selecting "None / Auto (Theme)" will show the theme texture if there is one.
- **Material**: Allows to select a material for the dice. Selecting "Auto (Theme)" will show the theme material if there is one. Default is "plastic".
- **Font**: Allows to select a font for the dice. Selecting "Auto (Theme)" will use the theme font instead.
- **Label Color**: Allows to change the color of the dice label. 
- **Dice Color**: Allows to change the color of the dice.
- **Outline Color**: Allows to change the color of the dice label outline.
- **Edge Color**: Allows to change the color of the edges of the dice.  

**Note:** You can click on any dice to customize it instead of using a global settings for all the dice.

## Preferences
![Preview](./settings-preferences.jpg?raw=true)
- **Automatically Hide**: When enabled, the dice disappear automatically after the result is displayed.
- **Millisecs Before Hiding**: time in milliseconds after which the dice disappear automatically.
- **Hide FX**: Effect used during dice hiding
- **Sound Effects**: When enabled, custom sounds with "realistic" collision effects are played when the dices roll.
- **Mute all sounds for GM/Blind/Self rolls**: Useful if you don't want your players to hear your secret dice rolls through Voice Chat.
- **Sound Volume**: Let you change the dice sound effect volume. This setting is applied on top of the "Interface" volume bar.
- **Table surface for sounds**: Allows to select the type of sound made by dice hitting the virtual table.
- **Auto Scale**: When enabled, auto scale the dice dimension based on the display size.
- **Manual Scale**: Allows to manually change the scale of the dice.
- **Animation Speed**: Change the speed at which the dices roll.
- **3D layer position**: Select if dice appear on top of the UI or under.
- **Throwing force**: Change the magnitude of the vector applied to roll the dice. Let you either gently roll the dice or throw them with full force like a mad man.
- **Override your dice appearance**: By default, a dice appearance can be changed when a flavor text is added to the roll. Uncheck to disable. 

## Special Effects
![Preview](./settings-sfx.jpg?raw=true)
- **Show other players special effects**: When enabled, it will play the special effects from other players settings. Disable to only show your own.
- **Settings**: Some special effects require further options to work properly. Click on the Gear icon to access these options. 
- **Add**: You can add special effects. A special effect is a short animation and/or sound played when a die roll on a specified result. Ex: Rolling a native 20 on a d20.

## Performance
![Preview](./settings-performance.jpg?raw=true)
- **Image Quality**: Quality presets to help you optimize your image quality.
- **Advanced lighting**: When enabled, use realistic lighting (HDRI). Disabling this setting will drastically change the image quality but will improve performance.
- **Shadows Quality**: Allows to select the shadows quality. Can help with performances on some PCs.
- **Glowing lights**: When enabled, dice with light effects will glow.
- **Anti-aliasing**: When enabled, dice will be rendered with anti-aliasing. MSAA is the best option for this but requires a GPU with WebGL2 capabilities.
- **UHD resolution support**: When enabled, it will upscale the 3D view to benefit from the extra pixels. Only have an effect on HDPI screens (like Retina display, 4k, etc). High-end GPU needed. No effect if you screen is not HDPI.

## Backup & Restore
![Preview](./settings-backuprestore.jpg?raw=true)
- **Save As**: Manage your save files. You can have an unlimited number of save files to rapidly switch between multiple settings.
- **Load**: Load a previously created save file.
- **Import**: Import a Dice So Nice setting file from a local file.
- **Export all**: Export all settings (appearances, preferences, sfx, performance settings) to a JSON file.
- **Export Special effects**: Export only the Special effects list to a JSON file.
- **Reset to Default**: Reset all settings to their default value.

## Rollable Area Settings

![Preview](./rollable-area-settings.jpg?raw=true)

With this setting it is possible to limit the area of the screen that shows the animation of the 3D dice.
Useful for example for those who stream online sessions and show only a portion of Foundry canvas on the screen
Just resize and/or move the shape and press **"Apply"** on the left window to change and save the Rolling Area for the current user.   
Press **"Restore"** to return to default settings.   
A few considerations:
- The custom rollable area defined in this way is static, therefore it does not adapt to the resize of the browser window
- If "auto scale" is enabled, the size of the dice adapts to the size of the rollable area, so it shrinks compared to when the area occupies the entire screen. Disable the auto scale and set a custom size that is correct for your use.
